# Async Redux Lab: Pictures of Cats

Who doesn't want to look at pictures of cats? Well, now you can look at up to 20
pictures of cats with our new React + Redux app. All you have to do is...build
it yourself! In this lab, you are tasked with building out a React + Redux app
that fetches data using Thunk. Since this is a pretty specific task, we'll walk
through it a bit in this Readme. Let's get started! 

## Objectives

1. Use Redux-Thunk middleware to make an asynchronous web request in an action
   creator function
2. Dispatch an action from the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.

## Instructions

We'll build out our app following the **container pattern**. We'll have one
top-level component, `App`, that connects to the store and gets data from the
state via `mapStateToProps`. `App` will render a child presentational component,
`CatList`, which will receive the list of cat pics from `App` and render them in
a series of `<img>` tags.

We'll be getting our cat pics from a real API! Sort of. We made a very special
API just for you to use with this lab (aren't you so lucky). We've got a GitHub
repository set up with GitHub pages to deliver a JSON file. If you point your
browser to [https://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/cat-api/cats.json][Static JSON] you should see a JSON collection of 20 cat image objects. Now that we have
a source for the data, we'll need to set up Redux and Thunk.

### Part 1: Set Up the Store and Reducer and Action Creator

#### Configuring the Store

First things first, use Redux's `createStore()` function to initialize your
store in `src/index.js`. To get Redux configured, we'll need to import
`createStore` from `redux` and `Provider` from `react-redux`. We'll also need to
import a reducer. We haven't written it yet, but let's import from
`src/reducers/catsReducer.js`. We pass this reducer into `createStore`,
assigning the return value to `store`. Then, we'll wrap the `App`
component in `Provider` and pass `store` to it:

```js
// ./src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import catsReducer from './reducers/catsReducer.js';

const store = createStore(catsReducer)

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This is the Redux configuration we've seen previously. To implement Thunk, we'll
need to also import `applyMiddleware` from `redux` and `thunk` from
`redux-thunk` (package already included in `package.json`). We pass `thunk` into
`applyMiddleware()`, and pass _that_ in as the second argument for
`createStore`:

```js
// ./src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import catsReducer from './reducers/catsReducer.js';

const store = createStore(catsReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk))

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

We have the setup for connecting Redux to the React app, and
we've configured Thunk. Now, we need to build out the reducer.

#### Setting up the Reducer

For our `catsReducer()` function in `./src/reducers/catsReducer.js`, we'll want
to set up a switch that handles two action types, `'LOADING_CATS'` and
`'ADD_CATS'`.

```js
// ./src/reducers/catsReducer.js

const catsReducer = (state = { cats: [], loading: false }, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'LOADING_CATS':
      return {
        ...state,
        cats: [...state.cats],
        loading: true
      }
    case 'ADD_CATS':
      return {
        ...state,
        cats: action.cats,
        loading: false
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export default catsReducer;
```

We also set up the initial state here. We can see that in the `'LOADING_CATS'`
case, `state.loading` becomes `true`, while the rest of `state` is just copied
to a new object. In the `'LOADING_CATS'` case, `state.loading` becomes `false`,
and `state.cats` is set to the `action.cats` payload (HINT: so we know we're
expecting a payload object with a `cats` key).

#### Setting up the Action Creator

Now, define your action creator function, `fetchCats()` in
`src/actions/catActions`. Remember, Thunk alters the behavior of action creator
functions, allowing us to _return_ a function that takes in `dispatch`. Inside
this function, we can execute asynchronous code, and, once resolved, we can use
`dispatch` to update our store with the remote data.

The `fetchCats()` action creator should use `fetch()` to make the web request for
your cat pic JSON. It should use a `.then()` function to parse the JSON of the
response to this request, and another `.then()` function chained on that to grab
the actual collection of cat pic image objects. Something like:

```js
fetch('https://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/cat-api/cats.json').then(response => {
  return response.json()
}).then(responseJSON => {
  // instead of logging here, call dispatch and send the cat JSON data to your store
  console.log(responseJSON.images)
})
```

Remember, we built the `catsReducer` to look for two action types. The first, `'LOADING_CATS'`, should be dispatched _before_ to the `fetch()`
request is called. The other type, `'ADD_CATS'`, should be dispatched
along with a payload of the cats JSON collection. Judging by the case
for `'ADD_CATS'`:

```js
...
case 'ADD_CATS':
      return {
        ...state,
        cats: action.cats,
        loading: false
      }
...
```

We can see that the reducer is expecting an action that looks like this:

```js
{
  type: 'ADD_CATS',
  cats: // cat data from the cat API
}
```

Putting what we know together, we can start by writing the basic function defintion:

```js
export const fetchCats = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {

  }
}
```

The first thing we want to do in this function is send a `dispatch` to indicate
we're loading (fetching) the cats:

```js
export const fetchCats = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'LOADING' })
  }
}
```

Then, we call `fetch()`, dispatching the returned data:

```js
export const fetchCats = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'LOADING_CATS'})
    fetch('https://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/cat-api/cats.json').then(response => {
      return response.json()
    }).then(responseJSON => {
      dispatch({ type: 'ADD_CATS', cats: responseJSON.images })
    })
  }
}
```

In this case, we just need the data inside `images`, so we can pass that
directly when calling the second `dispatch`.

### Part 2: Build the Container Component

Now that Redux and Thunk are set up, it is time to display the retrieved data in
our app. First, let's set up the `App` component to read from our Redux store.
We'll do this by first importing `connect` from `react-redux`, wrapping the
funtion around `App` on the export line. Then, we'll write a `mapStateToProps()`
helper function. This function will be passed into `connect`. `connect` calls
this function, passing in the state from the Redux store. Any key/value pairs
returned by `mapStateToProps()` will become props in the `App` component. We can
use this set up to confirm Redux is correctly creating its initial state and
that we're able to access that state in our React components.

```js
// src/App.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class App extends Component {
  
  render() {
    console.log(this.props.catPics)
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>CatBook</h1>
        {/* missing component */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    catPics: state.cats,
    loading: state.loading
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App)
```

Using the above code, you should see an empty array logged in the console when
the app is launched. This is the empty `cats` array in our initial state, now mapped to
`this.props.catPics` in `App`.

#### Dispatching the `fetchCats` Action

This is something new, so read carefully...

You might be wondering when/where we will actually dispatch our `fetchCats`
action to get all the cat pics into state. We want our cat pics to be
fetched when the `App` component is first loaded up. So, we'll enact a common
pattern in which we hook into a component lifecycle method to fetch the cat
pics.

#### The `componentDidMount` function

The `componentDidMount()` function will *always be called automatically when the
component is mounting for the first time*. This is the perfect place to go and
get the cat pics.

We need to define our `componentDidMount()` function so that it calls our
`fetchCats()` action creator. We also need to write out a `mapDispatchToProps()`
function to make `fetchCats()` available. We can then access the function as
`this.props.fetchCats()` inside the component and call this when the component
mounts:

```js
// src/App.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchCats } from './actions/catActions'

class App extends Component {
  
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props)
    this.props.fetchCats()
  }
  
  render() {
    console.log(this.props.catPics) // log will fire every time App renders
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>CatBook</h1>
        {/* missing component */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    catPics: state.cats,
    loading: state.loading
  }
}

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    fetchCats: () => dispatch(fetchCats())
  }
}
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App)
```

Ah! If we check the console, we'll see that `this.props.catPics` is set to `[]`
on the first two renders, but on the third, we see an array of 20 cat objects!
Notice that we still can call `dispatch` here, even though we're also calling
`dispatch` in our action creator.

> **Aside**: Why is `this.props.catPics` set to `[]` on the first two renders?
The first render is the initial render, which is always expected. The _second_
render, however, occurs when send our _first_ dispatch,
`dispatch({type: 'LOADING_CATS'})`. If we logged `this.props.loading` instead of
`catPics`, we would see the following logged:

```js
false
true
false
```

Once you successfully fetch cats, put them in state, grab them from state and
pass them to `App` under the `catPics` prop, you're ready to build the `CatList`
component.

#### The Presentational Component

We will leave the final task to you - buidling the `CatList` component. Your
container component, `App`, should render the`CatList` component. `App` will
pass `catPics` down to `CatList` as a prop. `CatList` should iterate over the
cat pics and display each cat pic in an image URL. Remember to use `debugger` to
take a look at the `catPics` collection and determine which property of each
`catPic` object you will use to populate your `<img>` tag and render the image.

## Conclusion

With all tests passing, you should have a working example of a React + Redux +
Thunk application. Of two components, one is purely presentational, just like a
regular React app. The other connects to Redux, but beyond that, is not any
different than a regular React + Redux app. Thunk lets us augment our action
creators and handle our asynchronous requests without requiring any major
changes to other parts of the applcation.

## Bonus

While we have a working application, there is one more thing we did not fully
implement: handling loading. If you've followed the instructions, you should
have access to `this.props.loading` in your `App` component. If we log this
value, we should see that it starts off `false`, then becomes `true` briefly
before switching back to `false` again.

While content is being fetched, it would be nice to show the user something -
often, spinning icons are used, but even just a simple 'Loading...' is enough
to show to the user that content is on the way.

How might we use the value of `this.props.loading` to implement a loading
message until the cat images arrive?
