1. Once you successfully fetch cats,
  a) put them in state,
    - I am not sure what putting the cats that
      was fetch from the api into
      state mean
  b) grab them from state
  this.state.cats
  c) pass them to App under the catPics prop,
<App cats={this.state.cats}>


   you're ready to build the CatList component.
